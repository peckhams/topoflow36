The filename is just this case prefix plus <b>_providers.txt</b>.\n",

    "EMELI will instantiate each of the listed model components as objects and will then check to make sure that each component can get all of the input variables it needs from other selected components (or on its own, from an input file).  EMELI \"runs the clock\", tells each component when to update its variables and orchestrates passing values of variables between all components.  If the components use different time steps, EMELI will automatically apply temporal interpolation.  For additional flexibility, a component can be disabled by setting a flag in its CFG file.  Disabled components are still instantiated but return only default values and do not perform any computation.\n",

    "Note that <b>conda</b> is the name of the package manager for the popular Anaconda Python distribution.  One feature of conda is support for multiple environments, which are isolated from one another.  When you install Anaconda, an environment called <b>base</b> is created for you and a base set of commonly-used Python packages are installed there.  However, you can (and should!) create additional, named environments and install different sets of Python packages into them without worrying about potential conflicts with packages in other environments.  Type <b>conda env list</b> to list your available environments.  You can switch to one of your other environments using the command <b>conda activate envname</b>.  (Replace \"envname\" with the name of an environment.) You can switch back to the base environment with the command <b>conda deactivate</b>.  It is better not to install new packages into the base environment.  See the online conda documentation on [<b>Managing Environments</b>](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html) for more information.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is always a good idea to update conda itself before creating new environments and installing packages in them. The \"-n\" flag is followed by the name of the environment to update, and the \"-c\" flag is followed by the name of the <b>channel</b> from which to get packages.  A channel is a collection of Python packages that are provided and maintained by some group.  The word \"defaults\" refers to\n",

    "refers to another popular collection and the GitHub organization that maintains it.  Many Python packages are available from both of these channels.  (However, the ipyleaflet and pydap  packages are currently not available in the Anaconda collection.) When you are installing several packages into an environment, the potential for installation problems seems to be less if you get them all from the same channel.  Keep in mind that packages you install will likely depend on many other Python packages, so there is a potential for conflicts, usually related to different package versions.  Using conda environments helps to mitigate against this and helps with <b>reproducibility</b>.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you've switched to an environment with <b>conda activate envname</b>, you can type <b>conda list</b> to see a list of packages.

Different environments give rise to different <b>kernels</b> in Jupyter, and the kernel name includes the environment name, e.g. <b>Python \\[conda env:tf36\\]</b>.  The kernel name is displayed in the upper right corner.  Notebooks typically open with the \"environment kernel\" they were created with. However, there is a <b>Change Kernel</b> option in the <b>Kernel</b> menu in the Jupyter app menu bar.
